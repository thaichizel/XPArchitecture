How This Works

Fetch Posts from posts.json:

The script retrieves all blog post data, including titles, dates, tags, and snippets.

Populate Blog Posts Dynamically:

Each post is dynamically rendered inside <section id="blog-data">.

Collect and Display Unique Tags:

All unique tags are extracted from the posts and added to <ul id="tags-list">.

Filter Posts by Tag:

When a tag is clicked, the script hides all posts that donâ€™t have the corresponding tag.

URL-Based Filtering:

If a URL fragment (e.g., #Architecture) exists, the script filters the posts automatically when tags.html loads.
